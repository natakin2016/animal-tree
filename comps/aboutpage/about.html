    <h1>How is a German Shepherd different than a Gray Wolf? 
The German Shepherd is a Canis lupus familiaris and a Gray Wolf is a Canis lupus.
What distinguishes homo sapiens from every other living creature is the mind.
Canis lupus, Canis lupus familiaris, homo sapiens are their scientific names based on criteria of classification.  All organisms are classified by an organized system of yes/no questions. 

Why?
The world is a global community. The classification system gives us a common language.  Homo sapiens in your high school mean the same in a high school in Japan, and mean the same at Harvard Medical School. What are these yes/no questions?
