    <h1>How is a German Shepherd different than a Gray Wolf? </h1><br>


The German Shepherd is a <i>Canis lupus familiaris</i> and a Gray Wolf is a <i>Canis lupus</i>.<br>

What distinguishes <i>homo sapiens</i> from every other living creature is the mind.<br>

<i>Canis lupus, Canis lupus familiaris, homo sapiens </I>are their scientific names based on criteria of classification.  All organisms are classified by an organized system of yes/no questions. <br>

<em>Why?</em>
The world is a global community. The classification system gives us a common language.  <i>Homo sapiens</i> in your high school mean the same in a high school in Japan, and mean the same at Harvard Medical School. <br>
What are these yes/no questions?
