<p>The Parazoa-Eumetazoa split happened 940 million years ago.
</p>

<p>Parazoa are similar to true animals as they too have differentiated cells.  However, they lack organs and tissue.  There is only <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sponge">one species of parazoa still living today</a>. 
</p>

<p>
  The hallmark of the Eumetazoa is having true tissues, neurons, and a unique embryonic progression [gastrula stage]

  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmPZNtCZmWI">Chordata</a> is a large and diverse phylum (over 43,400 species)!  Chances are, if you were asked to name an animal, it would likely be a member of this group.  Chordates all exhibit a rudimentary backbone and nerve cord at some point during their development, seeing the structure mature into what we recognize as a “backbone” or spine.
</p>

<p>Echinodermata include species of <a href="http://marinelife.about.com/od/invertebrates/tp/seastarfacts.htm">starfish</a>, sand dollar, and urchins.  They possess a remarkable ability to regenerate their organs and limbs.</p>

<p>Mollusca includes ocean creatures such as <a href="http://www.treehugger.com/natural-sciences/8-unbelievable-octopus-videos.html">octopus</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E-zodF-XrSE">cuttlefish</a>, and squid, as well as terrestrial species such as snails and slugs.  Most species possess eyes, some lay eggs.</p>
